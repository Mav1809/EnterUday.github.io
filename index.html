									<p>I used the chinook database and ran A/B testing on how the duration of a song in a music library results in business metric for all tracks, a particular album, a particular artist, a particular genre and a particular playlist. The results were recorded as a form of number of orders due to low/high duration of the song. And the statistically plotted results were recorded by using "Independent T-test".</p>

									<p>This project gives a brief analysis of all the terrorism events around the
										world from 1970 to 2019. Over 170,000 cases of terrorism have been
										analysed with comprehensive study of key parameters like trends,
										targets, tactics, weapons, groups etc.
										The data used for this analysis is obtained from the Global Terrorism 
										Database.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Impact on house prices due to incinerators<br />

										<span class="text">Python, ML, Exploratory Data Analysis</span>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/incen.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In order to locate a new incinerator site near our city, we must select the location such that there should not be any impact of its precense on the houses located in the vicinity. And if they do, then it will impact the house prices too.This is the case study that I have made to determine the impact of a incinerator siteâ€™s vicinity on house prices. For this, I have taken a dataset that has data of house prices corresponding to some other parameters like distance to incinerator site, property area, distance to the city center, and distance to the ring road,the land associated with a property, number of rooms, number of baths and age of the house. The data of house prices were recorded in two years (i.e 178 and 1981).On the base of this analysis, a model for predicting the prices of a house is constructed.</p>

									<p>Worldwide suicide rates have increased by 60% in the past 45 years, mainly in the developing countries and about a million people died of suicide every year. In this project, I have a come up with a case study of overview of suicides by performing an exploratory data analysis on the "Suicides rates overview dataset" that contains the information of these cases for a number of countries from 1985 to 2016 to extract the main parameters vulnerable to the increasing to suicidal rates.</p>
